	<h1>Simple Selectors (h1)</h1>
	<h2>Subheading 1(h2)</h2>
	<p class="highlight">
		The browser uses its selector API to traverse the DOM or Document Object Model, and pick out the elements matching the selector.
	</p>
	<p class="highlight">
		Next is the class selector, and the class selector is specified with a dot and the name of the class. In this case again, we're creating a blue class, a blue CSS class, that will color whatever it targets with the color blue.
	</p>
	<h2>Subheading 2(h2)</h2>
	<p>
		The class selector does require a little bit of a change to your HTML document in that each element that you want that class applied to has to have a attribute class equal to the class name. So in this case we have a p, the paragraph tag and div tag both have the attribute class="blue" and therefore, their content or their text content will be colored blue. Notice that a different paragraph that is not marked with attribute class="blue" is completely unaffected by this. 
	</p>
	<div>
		This is the main point of the entire article. So, attribute <span id="mainpoint">id="mainpoint".</span>
	</div>
