		 in this case it's a p, the paragraph tag, which is basically saying that whatever rules I'm about to give should apply to the content of every single paragraph tag in the entire HTML page.

		Now, the collection of these CSS rules is what's called a style sheet. Now, technically speaking, you don't have to have anything in the style sheet to be called a style sheet. An empty style sheet, it technically is a style sheet as well. But it's just not a very useful one. So, obviously, you would have at least one CSS rule in there. But, typically, you have way more than just one.
