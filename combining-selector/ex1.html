	<h1 class="highlight">Elements with Class Selector</h1>
	<p>The first one is with element with class selector. As you can see here we have a P element followed immediately without any spaces by a dot big which is a A class selector. And what this expresses is that I want to target every p element that has an attribute class equal to big.</p>
	<p class="highlight">This is p with class highlight. </p>
	<div class="mainpoint highlight">This is the mainpoint of the entire article.</div>
